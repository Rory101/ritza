# Ritza

Ritza is an early stage concept to

* Make advertising less evil
* Improve the quality of free technical content on the web 
* Allow better alignment between the goals of advertisers and the goals of their viewers
* Call out and avoid bullshit

We create technical content that is sponsored by companies which have technical products. This allows users who would be interested in the products find the products, and means that the companies have another avenue of marketing that isn't Pay Per Click digital marketing or SEO-focussed content marketing.

We create evergreen, high quality, long form, textual content. It is beautiful, loads fast, and is highly useful.

See [our pitch](content/pitch5) to start with.

If you really want, you can look at [our scratch notes](content/scratch), but these are not yet ready for general public consumption and are realsed purely for transparency.
