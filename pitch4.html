<h1 id="ritza---pitch-four">Ritza - pitch four</h1>

<p>We create long-form technical content that uses high quality prose and production-ready code samples to demonstrate how to use specific tech products to solve specific problems. Our content is commissioned by the companies selling the products, but we distance ourselves from <em>content marketing</em> and <em>sponsored content</em>, offering a new concept which we call <em>commissioned content</em>.</p>
<h2 id="elevator-pitch-for-tall-buildings">Elevator pitch (for tall buildings)</h2>
<p>We see the following problems in the world, and believe that they can be addressed simultaneously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay Per Click (PPC) or digital media advertising is the prevalent way that new companies with technology products find customers. This form of advertising is expensive, provides no long term value and relies on invasive tracking of users.</li>
<li>Companies often switch to so-called <em>content-marketing</em> as an alternative or supplement to paid media. This usually involves using non-expert writers to push out as much short, shallow content as possible, stuffed with keywords that might rank well on search engines.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, solo technical bloggers often create high-quality long-form content with technical depth. They do this for free, and usually after-hours. Although they are experts in their field, this content is often low quality in terms of writing style and presentation, as these bloggers do not have resources like time, editors and designers available to them.</li>
<li>Because of the above, although there is a very high <em>quantity</em> of content pushed out to the internet every day, there is very little <em>quality</em> content. It’s often hard to find the quality content that does exist in the firehose of adverts, clickbait.</li>
<li>Also because of the above, companies and readers (potential customers) are at war with each other, despite having several shared goals. Readers install adblockers and ban companies from posting content in their tightly guarded non-commercial communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ritza solves all of these problems by creating <em>commissioned content</em>. Our articles show step-by-step how to solve a specific problem using a specific product. Although we are transparent in each article about the fact that a company has commissioned it, the articles do not read like advertisements. They focus on showing how to solve a specific problem, and on explaining related concepts to the reader.</p>
<p>Because we have resources to pay editors, designers, and technical experts, these articles rank well on search engines for years, providing the commissioner with long term value and a steady stream of leads.</p>
<p>The articles are educational and high quality, providing the readers with similar value.</p>
<p>We align the interests of companies and potential customers, offering a stark contrast to the war that they are currently engaged in. Instead of blocking and avoiding our content, people subscribe to it. We ultimately aim to be the ProductHunt for high quality instructional technical content. Because our content focuses on how to solve a problem <em>using</em> a product, rather than on describing the product itself, consumers find it valuable, and some percentage of the readers will go on to buy the product being demonstrated.</p>
<h2 id="faq-no-theyve-never-been-asked-yet">FAQ (no they’ve never been asked yet)</h2>
<h3 id="what-are-you-actually-selling">What are you actually selling?</h3>
<p>Our technical articles differ depending on the commissioner, but for example a piece commissioned by <a href="repl.it" class="uri">repl.it</a> would be similar to <a href="https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/building-a-discord-bot-with-python-and-repl-it-miblcwejz">this one</a> (written by me). It is not an explicit advert for Repl, but it encourages readers to sign up for Repl’s product, and then focuses on showing the reader how to build a chatbot – a topic that Repl’s target market (beginner programmers and hackers) are interested in.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the post does not even need to mention the commissioner directly. For example <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/http-1-1-vs-http-2-what-s-the-difference">this article</a> (no affiliation to us) is commissioned by Digital Ocean. Because the article is high quality and published on a Digital Ocean domain, it increases their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Authority">domain authority</a> without explicitly advertising their product (although they do have a newsletter sign-up option displayed on the same page, along with their links and branding at the top of the article).</p>
<p>Although the phrase “content is king” is actively used in the SEO world, creating high quality content is <em>difficult</em> and it needs many people and a lot of time, not just a single copy-writer.</p>
<p>Commissioners that have their own blogs can opt to publish the content that they buy from us there. In the case of smaller commissioners which do not have the resources to maintain a well-designed, SEO-optimized and speedy content server, we publish the content directly on the ritza.co domain which ranks well (or soon will), and provide branding and backlinks back to the commissioner’s page.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-does-this-cost">How much does this cost?</h3>
<p>We are yet to finalise pricing, but we estimate that we will be able to produce 2000-4000 word articles for $500 each and 6000+ word articles for $1000 each. This includes any or all of topic selection, drafting, copy-editing, technical editing, QA, design, layout, and publishing.</p>
<p>We turn around articles in a few days depending on the amount of research and development time needed.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-you-keep-pricing-low">How do you keep pricing low?</h3>
<p>We tap into the emerging but fast growing remote workforce, which is the only place left on earth (haha) where demand still outstrips supply for tech jobs. Most of our employees do no more than 20 hours of work per week for Ritza, choosing to spend the rest of the time with their family, travelling, earning more cash-dollar at other places, or hacking on their own startups. This also gives us a huge advantage in attracting tech talent, as most other employers are stuck in an eight-hour sit-at-your-desk mindset left over from the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>We transform content creation from a solo, linear activity (where one person starts writing at the top of a blank page until they get to the bottom) into a collaborative non-linear process, as is partly described <a href="https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/writing-and-process-how-to-be-a-technical-writer-without-getting-stuck-s344bu38y">here</a>.</p>
<p>We also focus on building long-term relationships with junior writers and programmers, while the rest of the industry is focussing on hiring senior employees. We are a strictly <a href="http://www2.csudh.edu/ccauthen/576f12/frankfurt__harry_-_on_bullshit.pdf">no bullshit</a> organisation. We have a learning-first focus and our employees join not only for the money, but also for the life-long education and training we provide.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-business-model-and-on-what-timelines">What is the business model and on what timelines?</h3>
<p>I believe in bootstrapping and long-term goals. I don’t like the idea of venture capital funding, high growth for the sake of it, or giving up decision making control to investors. I prefer the strategies advocated by people such as DHH in <a href="https://basecamp.com/books/calm">It Doesn’t Have to be Crazy at Work</a>, solo founders such as <a href="https://levels.io/">Pieter Levels</a> known for Nomad List and and <a href="https://twitter.com/ajlkn?lang=en">AJ</a> known for Carrd.</p>
<p>Ritza will launch very quietly in Q3 or Q4 2019, potentially with no employees. I will work on proving demand for the product for a maximum of 12 months, hiring or contracting copywriters, editors, programmers, and designers if and as demand increases.</p>
<p>SEO is a long game and we are in it for the long game.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-like-high-quality-edited-content-why-dont-you-just-write-a-book">If you like high quality, edited content – why don’t you just write a book?</h3>
<p><a href="https://flaskbyexample.com/">I did</a>. found the process less than amazing. Although I had proofreaders, an editor, designers, layout people, and everything a writer could ask for, the focus was still on time-to-market and profit rather than on quality. Also, the book isn’t available for free, which makes me sad. I believe high quality content can provide long-lasting value to companies with products to market, and only limited once-off value to readers, so it doesn’t make sense to charge readers for content (and they’re more and more adverse to this idea as the quantity of free content increases anyway).</p>
<h3 id="where-do-i-ask-more-questions">Where do I ask more questions?</h3>
<p>This is the first content released by Ritza, and I don’t expect it to cover everything. If you’re keen to discuss or willing to provide feedback, it’s greatly appreciated. Ping me on <a href="twitter.com/sixhobbits" class="uri">twitter.com/sixhobbits</a>, <a href="gareth@dwyer.co.za" class="uri">gareth@dwyer.co.za</a> (Ritza email addresses coming soon), or if you’re in South Africa, find me on <a href="https://zatech.github.io/">ZaTech Slack</a>.</p>
