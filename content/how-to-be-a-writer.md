# How to write

People often ask me how to get into technical writing.

I would love to tell you it's easy and that you just have to follow my 5 step plan, but it isn't and you can't.

The two difficult parts about writing are doing it and editing what you have written.

Writing new stuff is fairly easy. Especially if you use short sentence and short paragraphs and writing about only a single idea. Going back to what you've written is harder and improving it is harder still. But nearly every single piece of great content you've ever read has been edited. No one writes publishable prose the first time.

Also I lied. Writing new stuff is not easy. Sometimes, you'll find the magical 'zone' and the words will fly out of your pen or off your keyboard, but this is rare and difficult to find on-demand. Even when you are in the zone, you'll look back and see that you are using phrases such as 'new stuff', and you'll wonder if you'll ever be able to translate that into a phrase that's actually worth reading.

The good news is that writing gets easier after the first 10 million words. The bad news, is that writing the first 10 million words is pretty difficult.

Writing 1000 words is not that difficult. If you write 1000 words for 300 days of the year, that's 300,000 words per year. Within 3-4 years, you'll have written your first million words, and things will start being easier.

So ask yourself how you can write those first million words. Can you find an hour every morning or an hour every evening to write? It doesn't have to be good writing, but you should be putting in conscious effort to improve (free writing a thousand words a day that you know no-one will ever want to read and that you know are not getting any better is not going to help you).

You should read as well. Find writers who's style you write. Look for the book 'On Writing Well' and read it at least twice.

But don't trick yourself into believing that you can learn to write just from reading. If you only have time for either reading or writing, choose to write. You always have to read what you write, so it's kind of like a 2-for-1 deal.

Try to write at least 500 words in each session. Less than that is too easy, and disjointed ideas are not valuable. If you can train yourself to write out 1000 words in a session, all cohesive, all focussed on a single topic, you'll be doing well.

Now go back and remove the 500 worst words. Now rewrite the other 500, and add 500 more. Repeat.

Try not to write about yourself. You're trapped in your own head 24/7 and it's fairly easy to write some of what happens in there down. Although there are some very successful people out there who wrote admirable autobiographies, most people who write about themselves are bores. Write to teach or write to entertain, but if your writing is full of the word 'I', it is unlikely to be interesting to many other people, and it unlikely to be the kind of writing that helps you as a writer improve.

If you want to write to educate, write about things that you have just learned. If you wait too long, they will seem obvious to you and you will forget about when the concepts that you now understand well were confusing and didn't make sense. If you write about stuff that you don't really understand, you'll just add to other people's confusion. Learn something, make sure you have mastered it, and then write the guide that you wish you had when you started. The topic does not matter - any time you find that you don't understand something and need to read multiple other articles or guides in order to gain understanding, that is the perfect time to consolidate all of that information in a new and updated place.

Don't worry about the fact that everything has already been written about. You do not need to be original to be valued. Most ideas have been thought of, most things have been tried, most things have been taught. Most of it is bad and out of date. Yours will probably also be bad, and it will probably soon be out of date, but if you worry too much about the universal picture, you will be too distracted to take smaller steps. Look at what other content there is on the topic that you are writing about, but don't spend too much time one this. Even if you find afterwards that there was a very similar piece already, no one will mind. Maybe your article had a different angle, or maybe it was very similar but it will be discovered by different people. If you learned something from writing it, it was not a waste of time.

Never write simply to increase your word count. It's fine to have word goals for your own daily writing exercises, and it's fine to have external constraints. But if you need more words and have run out of things to say, rather add a second topic. No one will thank you for verbiage.

Overall, you should aim to write 2 million words and publish 500,000 to 1 million words in the next 5 years. No other method of learning to be a better writer will outdo that.
