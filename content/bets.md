# The bets that Ritza is making

Nothing is certain, and although we dislike leaving things up to chance, we explicitly and deliberately choose a specific side in some long-running debates. We don't go for crazy ideas, but rather those that make logical sense, have shown at least some adoption, and which have been successful for others.

## Remote work is the future of work
Remote work is still an exception, although it is growing in popularity. We would list our reasons for choosing remote work, but [Remote Only](https://www.remoteonly.org/) has already done it better thn we could. We bet that over the next 10 years, nearly all companies will be partially or fully remote.

## Trust over monitoring
There are few things that are self supporting. Generally, claiming that something is true because it is true is known as "begging the question" or circular reasoning. However, *Trust* can be self supporting. Giving someone trust gives them a reason to not break that trust, whereas monitoring a person gives that person every reason to look loopholes. We tell a lot of people our goal, find a few people who share our goal, and then work together towards the common goal. We bet that over the next 10 years, *scientific management* and much of what is commonly believed today around human motivation will have been properly debunked, and that treating people with trust and respect will prove far more valuable than treating htem as resources. We bet that employees are as honest (or more honest) and as hard working (or more hard working) when given trust as when they are closely monitored.

## Transparency over secrecy
Businesses make money off information, and it's hard to make money from public information. Keeping your operations, revenues, policies, customers and other data a secret has long been held a sensible business strategy to stop a competitor coming along and cloning everything you do. We're confident enough that what we build is difficult enough to replicate even with all of our knowledge, and that the market is big enough for tens of thousands of clones, that we publish all of our data and learnings as widely as possible. This gives us free marketing, allows us to attract better talent, and encourages others to share knowledge with us too. We bet that sharing openly will not help competition to kill our business.

## Profit over Growth
We don't aim to be a one-man shop, but nor do we want to grow to hundreds of thousands of people. Although many businesses today put growth ahead of profit, and are successful through speculative funding or anti-competitive government tax breaks, we bet that profit is a better predictor of surviving the next decade than growth.
