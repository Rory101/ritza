# Marketing as education

When a measurement becomes a target, it ceases to become a useful measurement.

People care about metrics such as 'number of page views', because content with more page views, all else being equal, is probably better content. Better content makes customers happier. Happier customers are more likely to open their wallets -- both for the first time and on a recurring basis.

But if you create content with the _goal_ of generating as many page views as possible, you are not likely to create high quality content. You will spend most of your time on choosing a headline that many people will click on, and you will not give any thought to whether people will be _glad_ that they clicked on it. 

You will spend time looking for keywords that are popular with search engines, and stuffing these into your content to make it more likely to appear. You will pay an "SEO Wizard", who will tell you how to get your content in as front of as many eyeballs as possible. You will pay people for strategy, you will pay for tools that will "optimize" your content. Some of them will have Red, Yellow, and Green ratings, or scores out of 100. You will tweak and retweak until the scores are Green and close to 100. You will iterate on a short, shart snippet, over and over again, as these are the few words that will be displayed on the search result page -- the ones people will read _before_ deciding whether or not to click. 

You will pick hyped topics to write about, as there are bored people searching for blockchain, deep ai, internet of things, fintech, and smart cities. You will not care whether these topics are actually fundamentally interesting, or just temporarily exciting. 

You will spend time making pretty images and Twitter cards, and checking to see if your previews appear correctly on Slack, Facebook, and any where else.

You'll add popups and shiny things (maybe even an autoplaying video), because this will generate "user engagement", and user engagement is great!

You probably will pay a content writer at some point, or maybe get an intern to throw something together quickly. Quantity over quality. Strategy over content. Put words together and people will read them -- it doesn't matter what the words say.

This is wrong and misguided.

If you want page views, write content that is interesting and useful. Write content that _teaches_ people something that they didn't know, or something that they found confusing, or something that they needed more information about. People spend hours trawling the web, clicking on as many shallow useless articles as they need to in order to find something useful. They do not remember anything about the useless content. If they remember your branding on it, they will not think positively of it. If you teach them something, they might remember your brand. They'll also come back to reference the content again, and see your brand again, especially if you don't have a newsletter popup or something asking them to disable their adblocker.

Teach people. Nothing else really matters.
