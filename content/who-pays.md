# Readers shouldn't pay for content

In a standard free market model we have producers and consumers. Producers do work and create goods and are rewarded by consumers who pay to consume the goods without doing the work. The baker breaks a loaf of bread and sells it for money. Easy.

With digital goods, things become more complicated. It's not always obvious who is the producer and who is the consumer. Google produces the product Gmail and people use it to send emails to each other. It seems like Google is the producer and the user is the consumer, but the user doesn't pay. At least not with money. The user produces content which is aggregated and used by Google. Google gets value out of the huge database of emails to train machine learning models and other things. 

Even digital goods which behave more like loaves of bread than search engines and email clients do not cleanly fit into the producer-consumer model. People who eat bread are happy to pay for bread because they can easily conceptualise that the baker had to wake up at 3AM to bake the bread. The baker gets no benefit from baking the bread apart from the money paid by the breakfaster, and the breakfaster gives the money happily so that he need not wake up at 3 AM himself to bake bread.

Digital goods are more complicated though, and there have been problems with forcing the producer-consumer model on these for decades. The famous "You wouldn't steal a car" advert that used to run at the beginning of most DVDs as a campaign against piracy was laughed at for equating piracy to theft. "I would clone a car" people responded, and people who would never dream of stealing a 10c chocolate from a supermarket showed that they were happy to pirate $100 000 worth of media and software, as it wasn't directly harming the producer (especially if they claimed that they "wouldn't have bought it anyway"). In fact, some people even claimed that piracy *increased* sales, therefore benefiting the producer. 
Readers have shown that they are espeically unwilling to pay for digital text. Newspapers have been suffering and no one has found a successful monetization strategy for digital text. Amazon has profited a fair bit by selling Kindle Unlimited and other subscription services such as Audible, but this does not seem sustainable and a majority of authors are not able to profit from this model when the price per book is so low. 

Browsers like Brave are hoping that cryptocurrency and "microapayments" will be the answer, but they are still struggling to make this model viable, and they ahve received a fair amount of valid criticism. 

On the other hand, corporates are investing huge amounts of money to produce free content in order to have more readers and potential customers visit their site and to improve their search rankings so that actively looking customers can find them more easily. Nearly every technical book shows how to use a product of some sort or other -- often these products are free in the monetary sense, but companies are still happy to open their wallets to promote these free products. It's good for Google if people use TensorFlow because it helps them find employees and overall helps their brand against their competitors. It's good for AWS if beginners learn about the clowd using their platform. It's good for slack if beginner programmers learn how to develop chatbots using the Slack platform. 

Companies such as digital ocean, cloudflare, and others build out their own content teams and play the long game of SEO. 

Companies have money and are happy to pay to get the eyes and ears of readers. Consumers want free high quality content, but often can't find it. Through workarounds, companies manage to spend money to produce content, but this is not the "norm" -- yet.
