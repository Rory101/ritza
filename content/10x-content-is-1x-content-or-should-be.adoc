== "`10x`" content is actually just content - or at least it should be

If you’ve ever been involved in '`content marketing`', you’ve probably
heard of the phrase '`10x content`'. Just like in software engineering
many people believe that some developers are '`10x developers`' – people
who can do the same amount of work as 10 '`regular`' developers – in
marketing, it is well known that some content "`performs`" (in terms of
page views, or conversions) ten times as well as other content.
