# "10x" content is actually just content - or at least it should be

If you've ever been involved in 'content marketing', you've probably heard of the phrase '10x content'. Just like in software engineering many people believe that some developers are '10x developers' -- people who can do the same amount of work as 10 'regular' developers -- in marketing, it is well known that some content "performs" (in terms of page views, or conversions) ten times as well as other content. 

SparkToro lists the following criteria for 10x content .

>
1. Provides a uniquely positive user experience through the user interface, visuals, layout, fonts, patterns, etc.

2. Delivers content that is some substantive combination of high-quality, trustworthy, useful, interesting, and remarkable.

3. Is considerably different in scope and detail from other works on similar topics.

4. Loads quickly and is usable on any device or browser.

5. Creates an emotional response of awe, surprise, joy, anticipation, and/or admiration.

6. Has achieved an impressive quantity of amplification (through shares on social networks and/or links).

7. a problem or answers a question by providing comprehensive, accurate, exceptional information or resources.

Not all of these are required, but a minimum of 3-4 should be present in each of the pieces that fall under this label.

This seems to me a very low standard. Note that for point 2), you only need 'some substantive combination' of the listed properties, and overall, you only need 3-4 of the 7 points. I will ignore point 6), as there is substantial luck involved in making a piece go viral, and we have no evidence that this is correlated with quality (good pieces fail to go viral _and_ bad piece do go viral - there are also many ways to influence how widely a piece is shared, via fake accounts, advertising, or emotive headlines and topics). I do not thing that 1) is that important either: it should not be ugly, but a piece of content doesn't have to wow you with its user interface and visuals to be good: in fact, often the opposite is true. 

That leaves us with five points and these should be the _minimum_ standard for a piece of content to be worthy of publication, not the aspects that allow us to assign some kind of special status.
