# Elevator pitch
Globally, companies spend over 100 billion US dollars on paid search and social media advertising. The majority of the value they receive in return for this is *short-term value*: once a person has seen the advert and clicked on it, the company pays. There is some chance that the person will turn into a customer of the company, but once the adverts stop, so do the incoming customers. Companies must pay for new adverts every day in order to keep on sourcing new customers. 

Imagine if some of this money were redirected to making the world a better place while still giving the companies the exposure and sales for which they are willing to pay these exhorbitant amounts of money.

Ritza creates educational, text-based content, commissioned by companies as a form of marketing that provides *long-term value*. Each article is found and loved by hundreds of thousands of potential customers from the moment it is published and for years or decades into the future. The content is created by technical experts, and perfected through an iterative process involving writers, editors and designers, and fact checkers ensuring that, in terms of quality, it is among the top 1% of all content on the internet. 

Companies use Ritza because we can provide more sales at a lower cost. Readers use Ritza because we create content that is useful and a delight to read. Instead of pitching customers and companies against each other in the escalating arms race of adverts versus adblockers, we find the common goals of companies and their customers and allow them to be allies instead of enemies.

Of course, many so-called content marketing agencies already exist. They make the same arguments relating to paid media advertising, and they claim to provide higher value through content marketing instead. In our experience, they (and many of their customers) focus on rankings instead of on the content. They spend their time analysing existing content, looking for holes, and trying to trick Google into displaying their new content in a higher position. Also, most of this content is written by generic copywriters or marketing people instead of experts. 

Someone wise once said that went a measurement becomes a goal, it ceases to be a useful measurement. We measure our content partly by how well it ranks, but to rank well will never be a goal of our writers, and this exactly why they do rank. Very well.


## Unique selling points of our product

### Truly beautiful and accessible content with no distractions
User experience is the most important thing to us after the accuracy and quality of the content itself. All of our content includes great typography, custom-designed images, and is presented through modern, clean and fast-loading HTML without any adverts, tracking, or pop ups. We don't ask our readers to subscribe to newsletters. We don't warn about cookies (we have none). We give our readers the content they want and then get out of the way. All of our content is avilable to download in Mobi, ePub, PDF, nnd Markdown formats too, and all of them are perfect.

### Written by experts, published by experts
We don't bash out content that looks like it will rank well. Our subject-matter experts write about how they solved problems that they faced. We support them with world-class editors, educators, proofreaders, fact checkers, and designers, so each article we produce provides value to our readers at a level that cannot be replicated by freelance blogger or generic content writer.

### Hosting included 
Most smaller companies do not have the technical know-how or capacity to host their own content. It seems simple enough to spin up a WordPress blog, but trying to make your articles load fast, maintaining your content, migrating it due to changing needs, and maintaining SEO best practices takes a lot more effort than most people assume. We encourage our customers to allow us to host the content for them on Ritza.co. By hosting content for multiple companies, we build the domain authority of Ritza.co content faster, and benefit all of customers simultaneously. We include canonical links, back links, and branding of our customers in each article, so they do not lose out on the benefits usually associated with self-hosting content.

### Open source
All of our content is published under an open creative commons license. Our customers are initially surprised that they are expected to pay for something that is then made available for free, even for other to reuse, but sometime it's better to ignore problems than to fight them. While many people are worried about licensing, adding DRM to their content and sending DMCA takedown notices to sites that copy it illegally, they're spending their efforts wasting a losing battle, and even if they could win, it would have minimal benefits. If you're confident that you can provide better, more reliable content, with a nicer experience, people are going to find yours more easily than the bootlegged versions from people trying to make a quick buck.

## Competitive Landscape

## Unique selling points of our business

### No bullshit
We considered dozens of ideas about what our main defining factor should be. After looking at all of the things that we loved and hated across large companies, small companies, academia, and everything else, we realised that the central theme revolved around bullshit. There was just so much of it everywhere we looked. People being dishonest, office politics, ladder climbing, and bad science all had elements of bullshit. On the other hand, places where there was authenticity, a strong community, transparency, and all of the things we wanted, and almost no bullshit. Research has shown that it takes substantially more effort to identify and dispell bullshit than it does to produce, and this does not happen naturally. We build safeguards into everything we do to identify bullshit and to put an end to it before it grows out of control.

### Fully remote and flexible
We don't believe in offices, fixed work hours, or fixed locations. All of our employees work directly on producing content for around 20 hours per week. We believe that this is the average productivity of someone sitting a desk for 9 hours a day in any case, so we simply remove the desk and allow people to be non-productive without feeling guilty. In spite of this, we pay the same salaries that people are accustomed to for working a traditional 9-5 desk job. Between the flexibility and the high salaries, this gives us an almost unfair competitive advantage as it allows us to consistently source the top 1% of people globally.

### Completely transparent
We follow the lead of the Open Startup movement and operate under complete transparency. That includes salaries, revenues, customers, handbooks, and all of the other things that businesses usually regard as highly confidential. This allows to to contribute to and learn from a great community of businesses doing the same and allows our customers to verify our claims about our high ethical standards.

### Bootstrapped and profitable
In order to stay true to our ethical underpinnings and to avoid undue influence from bad actors, we will never take on venture capital funding. We are not Growth Obsessed, as focussing on growth is one of the easiest ways to lose sight of your original goals. We hire more people when we need them and when we can afford to pay them fairly, but not a moment before. We don't believe that it's necessary to reach a $1 billion valuation, or that it's healthy to even try.
