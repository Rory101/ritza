# Elevator pitch
Globally, companies spend over 100 billion US dollars per year on paid search and social media advertising. The majority of the value they receive in return for this is *short-term value*: once a person has seen the advert and clicked on it, the company pays. There is some probability that the person will turn into a customer of the company, but once the adverts stop, so do the incoming customers. Companies must pay for new adverts every day in order to keep on sourcing new customers. 

Imagine if some of this money were redirected to making the world a better place while still giving the companies the exposure and sales for which they are willing to pay these exorbitant amounts of money.

Ritza creates educational, text-based content, commissioned by companies as a form of marketing that provides *long-term value*. Each article is found and loved by hundreds of thousands of potential customers from the moment it is published and for years or decades into the future. The content is created by technical experts and perfected through an iterative process involving writers, editors,  designers, and fact checkers ensuring that, in terms of quality, it is among the top 1% of all content on the internet. 

Companies use Ritza because we can provide more sales at a lower cost than paid media advertising, while boosting their brand. Readers use Ritza because our content is useful and a delight to read. Instead of pitching customers and companies against each other in the escalating arms race of adverts versus adblockers, we find the common goals of companies and their customers and allow them to be allies instead of enemies.

Of course, many so-called content marketing agencies already exist. They make the same arguments relating to paid media advertising, and they claim to provide higher value through content marketing instead. In our experience, they (and many of their customers) focus on rankings instead of on the content itself. They spend their time analysing competitors' content, looking for holes, and trying to trick Google into displaying their new content in a higher position. Also, most of this content is written by generic copywriters or marketing people instead of experts. 

Someone wise once said that when a measuring tool becomes a goal, it ceases to be a useful measuring tool. Although we measure our content partly by how well it ranks, it is never a goal. Our writers write content that ranks well because it is good content, not because they are trying to write content that ranks well, and perhaps counter-intuitively, this is what makes their content rank so well.


## Unique selling points of our product

### Truly beautiful and accessible content with no distractions
User experience is the most important thing to us after the accuracy and quality of the content itself. All of our content includes great typography, custom-designed images, and is presented through modern, clean and fast-loading HTML without any adverts, tracking, or pop-ups. We don't ask our readers to subscribe to newsletters. We don't warn about cookies (we have none). We give our readers the content they want and then get out of the way. All of our content is available to download in Mobi, ePub, PDF, and Markdown formats too, and all of them are perfect.

### Written by experts, published by experts
We don't bash out content that looks like it will rank well. Our subject-matter experts write about how they solved the problems that they faced. We support them with world-class editors, educators, proofreaders, fact checkers, and designers, so each article we produce provides value to our readers at a level that cannot be replicated by a freelance blogger or generic content writer.

### Hosting included 
Most smaller companies do not have the technical know-how or capacity to host their own content. It seems simple enough to spin up a WordPress blog, but trying to make your articles load fast, maintaining your content, migrating it due to changing needs, and maintaining SEO best practices takes a lot more effort than most people assume. We encourage our customers to allow us to host the content for them on Ritza.co. By hosting content for multiple companies, we build the domain authority of Ritza.co faster and benefit all of our customers simultaneously. We include canonical links, backlinks, and branding of our customers in each article, so they do not lose out on the benefits usually associated with self-hosting content.

### Open source
All of our content is published under an open creative commons license. Our customers are initially surprised that they are expected to pay for something that is then made available for free, even for others to reuse, but sometimes it's better to ignore problems than to fight them. While many people are worried about licensing, adding DRM to their content and sending DMCA takedown notices to sites that copy it illegally, they're spending their efforts wasting a losing battle, and even if they could win, it would have minimal benefits. If you're confident that you can provide better, more reliable content, with a nicer experience, people are going to find yours more easily than the bootlegged versions from people trying to make a quick buck.

## Unique selling points of our business

### No bullshit
We considered dozens of ideas about what our main defining factor should be. After looking at all of the things that we loved and hated across large companies, small companies, academia, and everything else, we realised that the central theme revolved around bullshit. There was just so much of it everywhere we looked. People being dishonest, office politics, ladder climbing, and bad science all had elements of bullshit. On the other hand, places where we saw authenticity, a strong community, transparency, and all of the things we wanted were marked by a lack of bullshit. Research has shown that it takes substantially more effort to identify and dispell bullshit than it does to produce, and this does not happen naturally. We build safeguards into everything we do to identify bullshit and to put an end to it before it grows out of control, and this makes Ritza a desirable place to work, but it makes us more efficient and ultimately more profitable too.

### Fully remote and flexible
We don't believe in offices, fixed work hours, or fixed locations. All of our employees work directly on producing content for around 20 hours per week, from wherever they want, on their own schedules. We believe that 20 hours the average productivity of someone sitting at a desk for 9 hours a day in any case, so we simply remove the desk and allow people to be non-productive without feeling guilty. In spite of this, we pay the same salaries that people are accustomed to for working a traditional 9-5 desk job. Between the flexibility we offer, the high salaries, and the lack of geographic borders, we easily source the top 1% of talent, giving us a huge competitive advantage.

### Completely transparent
We follow the lead of the Open Startup movement and operate under complete transparency. This means salaries, revenues, road maps, handbooks, and all of the other things that businesses usually regard as highly confidential are made available to everyone at Ritza, and to the general public. This allows us to contribute to and learn from a wonderful and growing community of businesses doing the same, and it further allows our customers to verify our claims about our high ethical standards.

### Bootstrapped and profitable
In order to stay true to our ethical underpinnings and to avoid undue influence from misaligned incentives, we will never take on venture capital funding. We are not growth obsessed. We believe that focussing on growth is one of the easiest ways to lose sight of one's original goals. We hire more people when we need them and when we can afford to pay them fairly, but not a moment before. We don't believe that it's necessary to reach a $1 billion valuation, nor that it's healthy to even try.
