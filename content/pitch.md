# Ritza

Ritza is a working title for a B2B technical content creation company that produces technical content. This content is funded by our customer's marketing budgets (which are generally large). We advise customers to spend more than 10% of their paid media / PPC budget on longer form higher quality content that might not perform as well as paid media when measured on daily or weekly metrics, but which performs 10x to 100x better when measured on a time frame of more than 6 months.

## Goals

* Provide an alternative digital advertising platform and channel that outperforms PPC adverts and shallow 'content marketing'.
* Encourage more sustainable advertising habits, and allow companies to put their marketing budgets to good use (education and instruction) while still fulfilling their own goals (acquiring customers).
* Create a massive repository of online instructional material that is high quality and free to read globally.
* Create employment in South Africa by fuelling the demand for high-quality long-form written content.

## What does Ritza sell?

Ritza sells educational content. This is in the form of walkthrough tutorials, long-form articles, documentation, and research papers. The content shows how to use specific commercial products, such as online platforms and digital tooling. Our content does not read like an advert, but neither does it try to hide the fact it is promoting a specific product. 

For example, [this post](https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/introduction-to-machine-learning-with-python-and-repl-it-rln7ywkhc) is commissioned by the online IDE `repl.it`. The post shows how to set up a project using Repl, but it also explains some fundamental machine learning concepts that are not specific to Repl. It will rank highly and be useful both for people who are already Repl customers and are trying to work out how to use Repl, and also for people who have never heard of Repl, but are likely to be part of the target market (they are trying to learn basic machine learning, and Repl can make this a lot easier). 

The example is not a shallow click-bait piece that will get a lot of clicks the day it is published and pushed out on social media channels but then be lost to page 42 of Google forever after. Instead it is likely to be largely invisible at first, but grow in popularity over time as Python and Machine Learning groups discover it and link to it. 

## Who are Ritza's customers?

Mainly small to medium sized technology focussed startups, such as those providing developer tooling, technical platforms, frameworks, or other tools. For example (we have no existing relation to the following companies):

* [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/) would benefit from having content about machine learning and how to set up and run models on their platform.
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) would benefit from beginner web application development tutorials that show how to deploy code to their platform.
* [Kite](https://kite.com/) would benefit from any Python tutorials that use Kite to ease development.

Although the above are very programmer-focussed, any tool benefits from the same idea. For example:

* [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) would benefit from a post showing how to get events programmatically from a Google Calendar and then a comparison to see how much simpler it is to do so using the Calendly API.

Overall, anyone who has a product or service that can help customers solve technical or complicated problems would benefit from long-form content that shows by example how to use that product or service to solve a specific problem.

##  Why do customers buy content from Ritza?

PPC / paid media ads are expensive and although they have some benefits (easy tracking, easy experimentation, instant gratification), they provide zero long term value (you stop pushing them out and the customers stop coming). 

Some companies turn to content marketing, but they find that a) it is more difficult than just hiring a copywriter and setting them loose on your corporate blog and b) that it doesn't provide much in return (maybe one or two clickbaitey articles a year go viral for a few hours, but none of those clicks turn into conversions). 

By contrast, Ritza's content produces long-term value and leads to conversions for months or years after publication. We don't write "10 things about x you would never have guessed" type click-bait articles or "whitepapers" that are pushed out on a nice template but contain zero interesting content.

Ritza's content is also surprisingly affordable. We can provide several long and high quality posts a month for less than the cost of a single copywriter (and our content is passed between many experts before being released into the world). 

## What makes Ritza's content high quality?

Ritza provides content that has gone through a highly optimised publishing pipeline:

* **Topic selection: ** Select a topic that potential customers of our customers are interested in. Our market specialists generate several possible topics that are in-demand and haven't already been saturated. If required, our customer can pick their favourite topic at this point.
* **Outline: ** Our editors create an outline for the chosen topic. 
* **Research**: Our technical experts build something with our customer's product, and look at competing products.
* **Drafting**: Our copywriters produce a draft of the content, probably using code or other technical output from the technical research stage.
* **QA**: Our QA team does a walkthrough of the content, making sure all steps work as expected, nothing is left out, and that any instructions work on various platforms. The copywriter and/or technical expert make any changes required at this stage.
* **Copy editing: ** Our copy editors ensure that the prose flows well and is free from any grammar nasties. 
* **Design**: Our designers take care of adding images and illustrations to the posts to make them a pleasure to read.
* **Publication**: We provide the content in any format that our customers might want, and promote it on our own platform too. Readers can choose to view it online, as a beautifully formatted PDF, or on their ereaders as .epub or .mobi files. We can also integrate into our customers existing blogs (e.g. wordpress) to make distribution completely seamless.

## What makes Ritza's content affordable

Ritza has a unique structure and business model that allows it to produce high quality content at a lower cost. We are partly a business and partly a training academy and we take advantage of several factors, including:

* Our employees are in South Africa where living costs are low but all education is in English, giving South Africa a huge advantage in the content creation marketplace.
* Most of our customers are tech startups, often based in Silicon Valley where salaries are astronomical. 
* Companies globally focus on hiring senior employees. We focus on hiring and training people with 0-2 years of experience and we therefore find it easy to source talented writers and technologists. We pay salaries that are usually 150% of the average salary for equivalent work, ensuring that we have no shortage of top talent.
* By combining the expertise of many different people (writers, programmers, editors), we can produce high quality content more quickly than a person working on their own.

## Moonshot version

While we are fairly confident in producing higher quality technical content at a lower cost, there is another false paradox that we would love to bust. What if Ritza chose its customers instead of waiting for customers to choose us? Ritza could take on a ProductHunt like feel where readers actively watched the Ritza platform for new content, which would not only be high quality, but also guaranteed to be from "good" companies that the tech community would value hearing about. 

This opens a whole bunch of new problems, including:

* Greatly restricting the the potential Ritza customer base (most tech startups today chase revenue and growth at all costs).
* Needing an objective way to differentiate between "good" and "bad" companies. 
* Making the supply/demand co-dependency far more difficult to break. We would need a strong community to get good companies to join and we'd need good companies to build the community around.
