# Ritza: pillars

* The web is plagued by low quality content. 
* Three reasons for low quality:
  * Profit fuelled - companies only care about short term goals. They buy shallow content or PPC ads. 
  * Under resourced - people who write to educate and inform often do it in their free time and alone
  * Science / Arts divide - from a young age people are put into "science" or "arts" buckets. People who are good at science don't learn how to write and communicate well (computer scientists). Journalists and English lit majors are scared of technology and "hard sciences", and eventually end up writing the shallow content from 1).

* Advertising is evil. Companies invade people's privacy, use psychological manipulation, and ride the grey line of AI ethics to make short term sales at all costs.

* Educational resources that are high quality and freely available are hard to find
