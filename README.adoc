== Ritza

Every day, around 2 million new pieces of content are pushed out onto
the internet.

Most of it is bad.

Companies spend billions of dollars trying to create content that will
draw potential customers to their sites. Readers ignore them. Or block
them.

Readers spend billions of hours trawling through increasingly bad search
results, looking for the content that will help them gain new knowledge
and discover new things. But more and more often, they come away
disappointed. Even after going to page 2 of Google, they could only find
fake news, advertising, and bad quality writing on slow loading sites
full of adverts and other distractions.

Ritza creates text-based content that people want to read. We give it to
them, and then get out of their way to let them read it. Our content
teaches people what they want to know. It is written by professional
writers, edited by professional editors, and designed by professional
designers.

It is free for everyone, shared under open licenses. It loads fast, and
looks beautiful. Most importantly, it is informative and it educates
people.

"`Marketing`" has become a dirty word, and marketing departments use
dirty tactics to trick people into doing things that they do not want to
do (such as drinking unhealthy, unpleasant, black liquid).

But marketing wasn’t always like this. And it doesn’t have to be.
Instead of using dark patterns to trick people into buying stuff that
they don’t want or need, marketing teams can use Ritza to give their
customers what they really do want. Knoweldge.

=== What makes Ritza’s content different
Most technical content on the web falls into one of two categories. Either
* it is shallow, rushed, short, and full of CTAs to sign up for some product or use some service, but because it has a team of marketing professionals behind it, the page looks great and ranks well on Google, **or**A
* it is written by an expert who is passionate about the topic, and published on a small blog, buried deep on page 2 (or even 3) of Google. It probably contains typing errors or mistakes because it is the work of a single person, and it is possibly out of date, because no one has had time to tend to it.

Ritza creates 'Goldilocks' content, between these two extremes. Our writers are experts and passionate about creating and sharing knowledge, and they are well supported by designers, editors, and testers.

=== Created by a team of professionals

Ritza’s content isn’t hacked out by underpaid copywriters on tight
deadlines and small budgets. Each article is the result of days or weeks
of work, and a detailed creation process. From topic selection, through
outlining, drafting, editing, technical checking, design, and
publishing, Ritza’s articles get seen by many people, and each of these
people improves it. Each one of Ritza’s articles aims to be in the top
0.1% of content on the web.

=== Beautiful and distraction free

image:images/distraction-free.png[distraction free] Medium.com is
well-known for being extremely user hostile, but even other sites which
claim to have their readers’ best interests at heart are not shy of
ruining their content. Hackernoon (top right) has rows up rows of menus, reminiscent
of browser toolbars from the 90s (bottom right). Dev.to (top left) has many calls to action,
trying to trick the reader into failing at their initial goal – to read an
article.

Compare this to the beautiful site by Adrian Zumbrunnen (bottom left). All you can see
is text, because that is why you, as a reader, are there in the first
place.

=== Instructive

____
However, people are easy-going, and they have formed the habit of
reading page upon page of all sorts of such verbiage, without having any
particular idea of what the author really means. They fancy it is all as
it should be, and fail to discover that he is writing simply for
writing’s sake. (Schopenhauer,

Style])
____

Ritza’s articles never have keyword stuffing, boring reflections, or
catchy slogans. All of our content has a single purpose: to teach. And
each article teaches a single concept -- we don't have articles like 'the 5 hottest trends in x of 2020' that try desparately to appeal to a wide range of people and therefore manage to be uninteresting to almost everyone. Our content is practical, informative, and beautiful.
